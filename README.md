# CAMERA

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of Cross-Ancestry Mendelian Randomisation (CAMERA) is to estimate causal effect using summary statistics
in multiple ancestries. CAMERA aims to:

1. Select genetic instruments for multiple populations
2. Jointly estimate causal effects in an MR framework where exposure and outcome summary statistics are generated in different ancestral populations
3. Use multiple populations to understand pleiotropy

## Installation

You can install the released / development version of CAMERA from github
with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("universe77/CAMERA")
```

## Example

A basic example is provided in vignettes
