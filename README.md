The goal of CAMeRa is to estimate causal effects using summary
statistics in multiple ancestries. CAMeRa provides:

1)  Selecting genetic instruments for multiple populations.
2)  Estimating the causal effect where exposure and outcome summary
    statistics are from different ancestral populations.
3)  Jointly modelling causal and pleiotropic effects across multiple
    populations.

## Installation

You can install the released / development version of CAMeRa from GitHub
with:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("universe77/CAMERA")
```

## Example

See the vignettes for examples
